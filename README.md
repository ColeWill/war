## Concept: I wanted to recreate the card game "war" but make it more fun than just playing with regular plaung cards.  My I orignal idea involved using images like horses as the face of the cards, but then I discovered the pachimon card, and they had to be the focal point of my project.

## I wanted to ensure that my minimum deliverable project was something that I could actually build before the deadline, in order to give my self time to style and animate my game, and make it funny.
	I found that it was very difficult to hold back on the styling and funniness, so I ended up styling, worling on the concept and building the logic all at the same time.  

## Building the logic was by far the most challenging part, but once I got cards to show on the page, I felt empowered, and I knew I was going to be able to finish my project which was very rewarding.

The parts of the logic that I am most proud of are being able to randomize the card appearance, figuring out how to reset css animations using a setTimeout function, and this line...

$('#rightCardFace').css("background-image",'url(' +flippedRightRando.location+ ')'); 

...Where I use J query to append the card to the string, by adding a css declaration to an html container, by storing the card's url as a variable, and then concatenating it into the right part of the css declaration.

I am very proud that I was able to complete this assignment, and after our cohort ends I plan on coming back to this game and fufilling all aof my stretch goals, which are really just alot more css animations.
